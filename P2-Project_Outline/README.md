# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Equester will be a web application designed to provide equestrians with a platform to build profiles for their horses -- like a LinkedIn with hooves. These profiles can then be used to track vet and farrier visits, log trail miles, record awards and competitions, list horses for sale, and then transfer the profile upon purchase. Equestrians will earn badges for logging rides and healthcare practices, etc. For instance, Horses should be shod about every 8 weeks.  There will be a badge for equestrians that log 6 shoeings a year telling potential buyers that the horse has well-maintained hooves. Having a robust profile with lots of badges showing that a horse has been well cared for will increase the value of the horse. 

Horses will also be able to receive endorsements for having specific skills, traits, and aptitudes. For instance, a farrier may choose to endorse a horse’s behavior while being shod -- saying she was good-natured and calm -- or an owner’s friend might endorse the horse as gentle enough for new riders. These endorsements will give users and potential buyers key insights into the history of the horse -- its care, health, habits, genealogy, and abilities. For example, when I want to buy a trail horse, the first thing I look for is whether or not it can be ridden in a large group. On Equester, I will be able to endorse the horses in my riding group, and the group can also endorse my horse with the ability to comfortably ride in large numbers. 

With these searchable endorsements, potential buyers can narrow their search now not only by traditional means such as breed, age, and gender, but also by skill, aptitude, and background. With Equester, they can be assured that the horse they choose is the perfect fit for them. 

The basic MVP that I will focus on for this course will include Single Sign-on with Facebook,Google (at least). Users will be able to create a profile for their horses and log events.
